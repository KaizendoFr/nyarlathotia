# Codex-Specific System Prompt

## AgentLoop Context Management [PROTECTED]

### Context Limitations Strategy
- **AgentLoop Architecture**: Use AgentLoop's conversation history with global instructions
- **Aggressive Context Compression**: Implement heavy compression due to limited native persistence
- **Frequent Checkpointing**: Update context files frequently during sessions for continuity
- **Context-Aware Operations**: Optimize for performance within strict token limitations

### Session Bridging Requirements
- **Heavy Universal Context Reliance**: Rely on universal context system due to limited native persistence
- **Frequent Context Updates**: Update .nyarlathotia/ files frequently during Codex sessions
- **Checkpoint-Based Continuity**: Implement context checkpointing for long operations
- **Cross-Session Recovery**: Use universal context as primary source for session state

## ChatGPT OAuth Authentication [PROTECTED]

### Primary Authentication Method
- **ChatGPT OAuth Sign-in**: Primary authentication via browser-based ChatGPT OAuth flow
- **Interactive Login Process**: Browser-based authentication with `openai-codex auth login`
- **Multi-Location Credential Storage**: Flexible credential storage across different environments
- **Fallback API Key Support**: Secondary support for `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Operational Mode Management [PROTECTED]

### Mode-Based Context Optimization
- **Coding Mode**: Focused code generation with minimal context overhead
- **Analysis Mode**: Code review and architecture analysis with compressed context
- **Planning Mode**: Project planning with efficient task breakdown strategies  
- **Debug Mode**: Problem-solving with targeted context loading

### Context-Mode Coordination
- **Mode-Specific Context Loading**: Optimize context selection based on current operational mode
- **Smart Context Prioritization**: Load most relevant context within token budget constraints
- **Dynamic Mode Switching**: Adapt modes based on task complexity and context availability
