# Nyia Keeper Global Configuration
# Cross-assistant settings that apply to all assistants unless overridden.
#
# Precedence (most specific wins):
#   1. CLI override (--command-mode)
#   2. Project + assistant (.nyiakeeper/{assistant}.conf)
#   3. Project global (.nyiakeeper/nyia.conf)
#   4. Global + assistant (~/.config/nyiakeeper/config/{assistant}.conf)
#   5. Global (~/.config/nyiakeeper/config/nyia.conf)
#   6. Default (values below)
#
# To use: copy this file to ~/.config/nyiakeeper/config/nyia.conf
# or to your project's .nyiakeeper/nyia.conf for project-scoped settings.

# === COMMAND APPROVAL MODE ===
# Controls approval behavior when assistants execute commands.
#   safe  - require approvals / restrictive behavior (default, recommended)
#   full  - suppress approval prompts via assistant-native flags
#            Only use in trusted/isolated environments (e.g., containers).
NYIA_COMMAND_MODE="safe"

# === RAG SETTINGS ===
# Default embedding model for codebase search across all assistants.
# Per-assistant .conf files can override this value.
# Options: nomic-embed-text (768d, fast), mxbai-embed-large (1024d, accurate)
NYIA_RAG_MODEL="nomic-embed-text"
